    Predefined methods that compile single-qubit Qiskit circuits into pulse block ensembles.

    A single-qubit rotation has an axis in the equatorial plane and an angle. The axis becomes the
    phase of the microwave drive and the angle becomes the area of the pulse envelope, so the pulse
    length is |angle| / pi times half the Rabi period. An rz gate emits no pulse; it shifts the
    phase of every later pulse instead. A negative angle is a rotation about the opposite axis, so
    its sign adds 180 degrees to the drive phase.

    The envelope comes from the generation parameters, as for every other predefined method. Since
    the rotation angle is set by the pulse area, a non rectangular envelope delivers less rotation
    than a rectangular one of the same length and peak. The `area_match` parameter compensates for
    this by stretching the pulse (duration), by raising the peak (amplitude) or not at all (none).

    One block holds the pulses followed by the laser readout, the laser delay and the wait time, in
    the same arrangement as the rabi method, and is repeated by the pulse generator.
